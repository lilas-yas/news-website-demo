  **Design Movement**: **Modernist Swiss Style (International Typographic Style)**
  
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Content First**: The design should recede to let the news speak. High readability is paramount.
  2. **Grid Precision**: A strict, visible or felt grid system that organizes dense information without clutter.
  3. **Objective Clarity**: Use of neutral colors and clean lines to convey impartiality and trustworthiness.
  4. **Hierarchy through Typography**: Size and weight of type alone dictate the importance of a story, minimizing decorative elements.

  **Color Philosophy**: 
  *   **Monochrome Foundation**: Black text on white background for maximum contrast and traditional newspaper feel.
  *   **Signal Red (#D32F2F)**: Used sparingly for breaking news, urgent alerts, and primary calls to action (Subscribe). Represents urgency and authority.
  *   **Cool Grays**: For secondary text, borders, and backgrounds to soften the starkness of black and white.

  **Layout Paradigm**: 
  *   **Modular Grid**: A 12-column grid where stories are blocked out in rectangular modules.
  *   **Asymmetric Balance**: Not everything is centered. A heavy lead story on the left might be balanced by a list of smaller stories on the right.
  *   **Dense but Breathable**: High information density (like a real newspaper) but with calculated padding to prevent visual fatigue.

  **Signature Elements**:
  *   **Heavy Dividers**: Thick black lines separating major sections (header, footer, primary stories).
  *   **Category Tags**: Small, uppercase, sans-serif tags above headlines (e.g., "POLITICS", "TECH").
  *   **Serif Headings / Sans-Serif Body**: A classic pairing that evokes authority (Serif) and modern readability (Sans-Serif).

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  *   **utilitarian**: Hover effects are subtle (underline or slight color shift). No bouncing or excessive motion.
  *   **Fast & Direct**: Interactions should feel instantaneous. The focus is on getting to the reading experience quickly.

  **Animation**:
  *   **Minimal Fade-ins**: Images load with a quick, smooth fade.
  *   **No Distractions**: Avoid movement that draws the eye away from reading.

  **Typography System**:
  *   **Headings**: **Merriweather** (Serif) - Bold, authoritative, traditional.
  *   **Body**: **Inter** or **Roboto** (Sans-Serif) - Clean, neutral, highly legible at small sizes.
  *   **UI Elements**: **Inter** (Uppercase, tracking wide) for navigation and tags.

  **Design Movement**: **Neo-Brutalist / Digital Native**
  
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Raw & Unfiltered**: A design that feels immediate and slightly "undesigned" to appeal to a younger, internet-savvy audience.
  2. **High Contrast**: Stark differences in size and color to grab attention in a crowded feed.
  3. **Functional Borders**: Visible borders around every card and section to strictly compartmentalize content.
  4. **System Fonts**: Leaning into the default look of the web to suggest speed and lack of pretension.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  *   **Paper White & Ink Black**: The base.
  *   **Highlighter Colors**: Neon yellow, electric blue, or vibrant purple for accents, highlights, and active states. Mimics the act of highlighting physical paper.
  *   **No Gradients**: Flat, solid colors only.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  *   **Bento Box / Masonry**: Cards of varying aspect ratios fitting together like a puzzle.
  *   **Sticky Elements**: Sidebars or headers that stick aggressively to ensure navigation is always present.
  *   **Split Screen**: Strong vertical dividers splitting the screen into clear functional zones (Read vs. Explore).

  **Signature Elements**:
  *   **Hard Shadows**: Solid black drop shadows (no blur) offset by 4px.
  *   **Monospace Accents**: Use of a coding font for metadata (dates, authors, reading time) to give a "data" feel.
  *   **Outline Icons**: Thick-stroke icons that match the border weights.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  *   **Tactile**: Buttons depress (move down and right) on click.
  *   **High Feedback**: Hover states involve significant changes (invert colors, thick borders).

  **Animation**:
  *   **Snappy**: Instant transitions. No easing.
  *   **Marquee**: Scrolling text for breaking news tickers.

  **Typography System**:
  *   **Headings**: **Archivo Black** or **Oswald** - Tall, condensed, impactful.
  *   **Body**: **Public Sans** - Geometric, readable.
  *   **Metadata**: **JetBrains Mono** or **Fira Code**.

  **Design Movement**: **Editorial Elegant (Magazine Style)**
  
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Visual Storytelling**: Images are large and immersive. The design treats news as a narrative experience.
  2. **Generous Whitespace**: Luxurious margins and padding to give content an "expensive" feel.
  3. **Sophisticated Typography**: Use of high-contrast serifs and delicate sans-serifs.
  4. **Softness**: Rounded corners (but slight), soft shadows, and muted colors.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  *   **Cream / Off-White Background**: (#F9F9F7) Easier on the eyes than pure white, feels like premium paper.
  *   **Deep Navy / Forest Green**: Instead of pure black for text and headers, use very dark colors that feel richer.
  *   **Gold / Bronze Accents**: For premium features, subscription calls, and special reports.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  *   **Single Column Focus**: For articles, a centered, narrow column that focuses entirely on reading.
  *   **Magazine Cover Home**: The homepage feels like a curated cover, with one massive feature story and smaller supporting stories.
  *   **Overlapping Elements**: Images might slightly overlap text or other sections to break the grid.

  **Signature Elements**:
  *   **Drop Caps**: Large initial letters for the start of long-form articles.
  *   **Pull Quotes**: Large, stylized quotes breaking up the text.
  *   **Serif Navigation**: Even the menu uses a serif font for elegance.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  *   **Fluid**: Smooth, slow transitions. Parallax effects on hero images.
  *   **Gentle**: Hover effects are slow fades or slight zooms.

  **Animation**:
  *   **Parallax**: Background images move slower than foreground text.
  *   **Smooth Scroll**: The page glides rather than jumps.

  **Typography System**:
  *   **Headings**: **Playfair Display** - High contrast, elegant, editorial.
  *   **Body**: **Lora** or **Merriweather** - Great for long-form reading.
  *   **Accents**: **Lato** - Clean, minimal sans-serif for captions and UI.
